<p> I utilise most of my free time working and educating myself about the robotics and controls. <br />
Here is a comprehensive list of the projects I am working on or have taken up while my time <br />
at IIT-B. I have worked on a bunch of technical & research projects involving drones.</p>


<h2>Research Experience</h2>
<h3> Fault Detection in Robotic Swarms | Prof. Giovanni Beltrame</h3>

<td align="left">
<p><b> Duration: May 2018 - Jul' 2018</b></p>
<p>As a summer research intern at the Making Innovative Space Technology Lab (MISTLAB), at<br/>
Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal, Canada. I was working with Vivek Shankar Varadharajan (Ph.D. Candidate).<br/>
The work by Tarapore Danesh, Anders Lyhne Christensen, & Jon Timmis <i>“Generic, scalable and decentralized<br/>
fault detection for robot swarms.”</i> have adopted the cross regulation of the adaptive immune system of vertebrates<br/>
for multi-agent robotic systems and used it to dectect faults in robotic swarms.</p>

<p>We are working to build on their work to come up with a strategy to classify the detected faults on a swarm of <br/>
KheperaIVs. I integrated the cross regulation model developed for E-pucks with the Khepera IV ARGoS3 Model.<br/> 
We intend to the extend the study to include more types of anomalies for differenr robots and environments.</p>

</td>
<td align="left">
<p><b> Duration: Dec' 2017 - May' 2018</b></p>
<p>At the Embedded Controls Lab, the spherical robot was developed previously. It is currently operated using<br/>
an android application. The autonomous operation of the robot required development of a control loop and a<br/>
strategy for outdoor state estimation. I was working to develop the later using an inertial measurement unit <br/>
with WiFi. Additionally, we intended to make the robot throwable and it required an appropriate mateiral <br/>
selection. With the PEEL Lab headed by Prof. Dipti Gupta at IIT-B, I performed experiments to study the effects of <br/>
temperature & composition on the tensile strength of the material to be used for fabricating the shell of the robot. </p>

<p>This was my Bachelor's Thesis project and required me to do a thorough literature survey before <br/>
experimenting in the lab. The experimentation involved motion analysis using VICON motion capture systems<br/>
and testing of mechanical properties of the material films.</p>

<h2>Technical Experience</h2>
<br/>
<p>The team EXO-FLY at IIT-B has been working for quite sometime on the development of a compact flying technology <br/>
for the Boeing sponsored competition Go-Fly. The control system has yet to be developed for the proposed on-paper<br/>
design for the vehicle. I have recently started working under the guidance of Prof. Srikant Sukumar. I am working on <br/>
modelling the system dynamics of the vehicle. Later, we intend to develop the control system for the same.</p>

<h3>Setup of Spiri - Drone by Pleaides Robotics</h3>

<td align="center">
<p><b> Duration: May' 2018 - Jul' 2018</b></p>
<p>Spiri is an autonomous drone equipped with Nvidia TX1/TX2 and stereo vision cameras that uses the Pixracer<br/> 
flight controller. The on-board computer runs an Ubuntu 16.04 with ROS-Kinetic. The internship at Mistlab <br/>
involved setting up of the drone for formation flights along with other drones already being used in the lab.<br/></p>

<p>
The setup required loading the TX1 with the necessary packages including ROSBuzz. A Hardware-in-the-loop<br/>
simulation (HITL) followed to test the real flight controller hardware with the actual flight code(ROSBuzz). <br/>
Gazebo is connected to QGroundControl(Mission Planning software) via UDP that bridges its MAVLink<br/>
messages to PX4. Later, the Mavros/Custom Modes for the PX4 flight stack were figured out for the ROSBuzz node.

<h3>Quadrotor 3D Planning and Navigation</h3>
<p><b> Duration: May' 2017 - Jun' 2017</b></p>
<p>
I spent my second-year summers getting acquainted with motion planning and navigation in Quadrotors.<br/>
I worked my way through ROS, and Gazebo to implement a basic motion planning strategy. I was also successful<br/>
in navigating the Quadrotor between desired waypoints using the MoveIt assistant.</p> 

<p>I studied the problem of Simultaneous Mapping & Localisation and learnt to implement it using odometry and<br/>
and camera. This particular study had me intrigued about Robotics and I started educating myself about control<br/>
theory and it's applications in aerospace which I was already inclined towards.

<h3>Hydrogen Peroxide Ethanol Rover (HYPER) | Prof. Arindrajit Chowdhury</h3>

<p><b> Duration: Sept' 2016 - Apr' 2017</b></p>
<p>
Drone survillence is a field that has seen a lot of growth in the past decade. A drone that can disguise itself in the environment<br/>
would fit the application well. A flapping wing drone would serve this purpose quite aptly. We formed a team in Sept'16 to<br/>
develop an Ornithoptor. The use of a mono-propellant as fuel was being developed in Prof. Chowdhury's lab. We intended to<br/>
use this method to flap the wings of the drone to generate thrust.
</p>
<p>
I was primarily working on the fabrication of the Ornithopter which involved design and manufacture of wings. We made large<br/>
wings of 1m span with S-1020 airfoil. The next step was to make these giant wings flap. We  made a crank-rocker mechanism<br/>
based gear box for power tranmission and initially flapped wings with the help of a battery. The flapping initially was only an<br/>
up-down motion of the huge wings. Meanwhile, we needed a method to measure the thrust generated by this flapping. We<br/>
manufactured a 'Test-Rig' to measure the generated thrust using a s-type load cell. In the later stages, I was wokring on<br/>
developing a strategy to control the wings. I directed my efforts to measure the precise position of Wings in space using hall<br/> 
sensors to feed it to the fed micro-controller and adjust the servo motors to adjust the angle of attack and torsion in the wing.<br/>

<h3><a href="https://www.facebook.com/TeamRakshak/"><u>Rakshak</u></a>, Student Technical Team | Prof. Aditya A. Paranjape</h3>
<p><b> Duration: Sept' 2016 - Dec' 2016</b></p>
<p>
Rakshak is a student technical team that works to develop an Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for Aero Design Competition<br/>
organised by the Society of Automotive Engineers-International, USA. I was recruited as part of the 40 membered student<br/> 
team. At the Aerodynamics subsystem, we analysed and designed different factors to ensure a stable flight and best possible <br/>
aerodynamic performance. I worked for the selection of suitable airfoil. The factors maximum thickness to chord ratio,<br/>
coefficients of lift/drag/moment and stall characteristics were analysed.
</p>

<p>
Working with these two teams, I got an insight of the importance of control in robotics and wanted to study the field. I took up<br/>
my first course in Spring'17. Later, I started working on acquainting myself with Robotics & Controls.

<h2>Course Projects </h2>
<p> Certain courses in my curriculum required me to complete a project extending over a month or so.<br/> These projects carry a 
10%-20% weightage of the total credits for the course.</p>


<h3>Controller Design of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle | Adaptive Control Theory, Prof. Srikant Sukumar</h3>
<ul>
For the course on Adaptive Control Theory, our team of 3 studied the formulation of the adaptive backstepping method and<br/> 
it's implementation to control the longitudinal flight dynamics (Flight Path Angle & Veloctiy) of a fixed wing UAV under the<br/> 
constraint of thrust saturation as presented in the scientific paper by <a href"https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/1.G000028"><i> F. Gavilan et. al., “Adaptive Control for Aircraft Longitudinal<br/>
Dynamics with Thrust Saturation”, JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE, CONTROL, AND DYNAMICS Vol. 38, No. 4, April 2015</i></a>. 
</ul>
